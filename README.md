Linux's repo will also be applied here.

## Dependencies

- A POSIX shell
- A POSIX awk
- procps-ng (needs pkill -s0,1)

### How to use it

To see enabled services for "current" runlevel:

    $ ls -l /var/service

To see available runlevels (default and single, which just runs sulogin):

    $ ls -l /etc/runit/runsvdir

To enable and start a service into the "current" runlevel:

    # ln -s /etc/runit/sv/<service> /var/service

To disable and remove a service:

    # rm -f /var/service/<service>

To view status of all services for "current" runlevel:
